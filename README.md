## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP emphasizes code reusability, modularity, and the organization of code based on real-world objects.

In this section, you will find code examples and explanations that introduce the core concepts of OOP, including objects, classes, methods, and properties.

## Classes and Objects

The foundation of OOP is the concept of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. This section explores how to define classes, create objects, and interact with them through methods and properties.

You will find code examples that demonstrate class definition, object instantiation, constructors, instance variables, and methods.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a key feature of OOP that allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. This section explains how to use inheritance to extend classes, inherit properties and methods, and override behavior.

Code examples illustrate single inheritance, multiple inheritance (through interfaces), method overriding, and the use of superclasses and subclasses.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the creation of flexible and reusable code. This section delves into the concept of polymorphism, including method overloading and method overriding.

Code examples demonstrate how polymorphism can be used to write generic code that works with objects of different types but adheres to a common interface.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is a mechanism that allows the representation of complex real-world entities in a simplified manner. It enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for derived classes to follow. This section explores how abstraction is implemented in Java and how it helps in achieving modularity and code organization.

Code examples showcase the creation of abstract classes, abstract methods, and interfaces, along with their implementations.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details and exposing only necessary information to the outside world. It promotes data security, code maintainability, and flexibility. This section focuses on encapsulation in Java, including access modifiers, getters and setters, and data hiding.

Code examples demonstrate how to encapsulate data within classes and how to interact with that data through encapsulated methods.

## Interfaces

Interfaces define a contract that a class must adhere to. They provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java and enable loose coupling between classes. This section introduces interfaces and their role in achieving abstraction and polymorphism.

Code examples illustrate the definition of interfaces, implementation of interfaces in classes, and how interfaces can be used to write flexible code.
